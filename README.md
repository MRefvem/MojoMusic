# Change-Log

11 Aug 2020
1.2 *Refactored code base so that Products.cs can be read as a generic class. Created new class, Cereal.cs, that Products.cs then inherits from. Refactored services and controllers according to these changes. Bug fixes: navigating between routes after performing CRUD operations no longer breaks the site. Sort method free of bugs.*
