# Introduction 
This Ecommerce web app displays information about products as well as a home page. The theme of the site is "Mojo Music" and displays various musical instruments and studio products for sale. It has the ability to allow a user to view products, view information about a single product. Users can register, login and logout of their accounts.
The first time the seeded Administrator is registered, they are assigned the role of Admin and given claims that allows them special access to different areas of the site, including an Admin portal that is used to allow that person the ability to add photos to Azure Blob.
User Claims that are gathered for every user include First Name, Last Name, Username, Email and Password. These claims do not provide special access to any areas of the site unless that user is also an Admin. These user claims are captured within the RoleInitializer.cs class.

# Getting Started
To get started using this app:
1.	Install the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio
2.	Clone the Git repository into your local machine: https://github.com/MRefvem/MojoMusic.git
3.	Open Ecommerce-App.sln
4.	Run the latest build

# Build and Test
The app should simply be able to run through Microsoft Visual Studio. 

# How to login as an Admin and access the Admin Panel
- Login with these credentials: UserName = "admin@gmail.com", Password = "@Test123!"
- While logged-in as the Admin, you will see a link reading "Admin Panel" on the Nav Bar which leads to a dashboard which gives the Admin access to special operations on the site including the ability to see, create, update and delete products as well as upload product pictures to an Azure Blob Storage account.

# A description of the Products Database Schema
The products database contains the following tables: dbo.CartItems, dbo.Carts, dbo.Order, dbo.OrderHistory and dbo.Products. The dbo.Products table lists all of the products in the database and includes their properties such as Id, Name, SKU, Price, Description and Image URL.
The dbo.Carts and dbo.Order tables are join tables that link a specific user to their Cart Items and Order History, respectively. The dbo.Carts table contains the Id of the cart, the UserEmail associated with the user and a boolean describing the current status of the cart ("IsActive" when set to true means it is active, and when set to false means it is one of the user's past purchases). You can use the dbo.Carts table to link to the dbo.CartItems table which simply links a CartId with a ProductId and then gives the quantity of the item present in the cart correlating with the given product Id.
Much in the way the the dbo.Carts table links to the dbo.CartItems table, so does the dbo.Order table with the dbo.OrderHistory table. The dbo.Order table links an Order History to a specific Cart. The dbo.Order table contains a primary key to identify a unique order history in the database.
